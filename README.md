# Design Patterns

Design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem in a particular context.

Design patterns can be organized into groups based on what kind of problem they solve.
- **Creational Patterns** create objects.
- **Structual Patterns** organize classes and objects to form larger structures that provide new functionality.
- **Behavioral Patterns** provide communication between objects and realizing these patterns.
